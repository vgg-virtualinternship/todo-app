# This is a TODO APP built as an assignment for the ongoing VGG internship
# Pushing the "Enter" key would send your todo to local storage and also append that to the screen
# You can delete Todos by clicking on the "Bin" icon 
# You can also tag Todos as done by clicking on the outlined circle
# Or uncheck a Todo by clicking on the crossed out Todo

# To reset the local storage and all contents on the screen, click the refresh icon 

##### I do hope you enjoy navigating the app, and learn something new, leave a star if you like this mini app #########
